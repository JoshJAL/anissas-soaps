          Welcome to Anissa&apos;s Soap, where we take pride in crafting exceptional 100% organic handmade bars of soap.
          Each bar is meticulously made by Anissa herself, following the traditional Lebanese techniques passed down
          through generations in her family. Anissa&apos;s great grandma, hailing from the beautiful mountains of
          Lebanon, imparted her wisdom, ensuring that every bar carries the essence of heritage and expertise.

          Our soap is made exclusively from extra virgin olive oil, renowned for its nourishing properties, to provide
          you with a luxurious bathing experience. We carefully select the finest organic ingredients, avoiding any
          harsh chemicals or additives, to deliver a gentle and refreshing cleanse for your skin.
